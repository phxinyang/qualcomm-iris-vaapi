# Verify the AV1 OBU writer without involving the decoder hardware.
#
# src/av1_obu.cc rebuilds OBU temporal units from VA-API decode parameters,
# because VA hands the driver a parsed frame header plus bare tile payloads
# while Iris' stateful node needs a real bitstream. That reconstruction either
# reproduces the original stream's pixels or it does not, and that question is
# answerable with an independent software decoder.
#
# With V4L2_VA_DUMP pointing at a directory the driver writes every submitted
# access unit of a session into one file; for AV1 that is the rebuilt
# low-overhead OBU stream. This script decodes it with libdav1d and checks
# the result against a software decode of the source.
#
# Frame counts are expected to differ. AV1 repeats already-decoded frames with
# show_existing_frame, which carries no payload and never reaches a VA-API
# hardware accelerator, so the rebuilt stream contains only the frames that
# were actually decoded. What must hold is that every frame the writer does
# emit is bit-exact and in order, which is what the subsequence check below
# tests.
