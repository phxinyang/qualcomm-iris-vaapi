# Keep the distribution packaging honest about what actually gets installed.
#
# This project has already shipped the two failure modes this check exists to
# prevent. Desktop entries ended up in two directories at once because two
# install paths disagreed, and an entry for an absent browser stayed in the
# menu because nothing compared the packaged list against reality. RPM only
# catches an unpackaged file at build time, on a machine with the toolchain
# and the hardware arch; this runs everywhere, in CI, in a second.
#
# What it asserts:
#   * every path scripts/install-system.sh installs appears in the spec %files
#   * both manifests delegate to that script instead of open-coding a layout
#   * the runtime dependency the launcher cannot start without is declared
#   * the PKGBUILD parses as bash
