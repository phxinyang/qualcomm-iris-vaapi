# Fedora package for the Qualcomm Iris VA-API backend.
#
# The spec installs through scripts/install-system.sh, not `meson install`:
# that helper resolves libva's canonical driverdir and writes the provenance
# manifest. test/iris-packaging-check.sh holds all three package formats to
# that one layout.

# Building from a git checkout:
#
#   sh scripts/make-dist.sh --out ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
#   rpmbuild -ba packaging/fedora/libva-v4l2-iris.spec \
#       --define "source_commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
#       --define "tracked_sha256 $(git ls-files -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')"
#
# Omitting the defines is allowed and records the install as dirty, which is
# the honest answer when the source identity was not supplied.

# The VA video processor (scale, crop, rotation, mirroring, tone mapping,
# compositing) is Vulkan compute and stays behind V4L2_VA_VPP at runtime, but
# a package built without the loader and headers would not carry it at all.
# All three package formats depend on it for the same reason.
BuildRequires:  pkgconfig(vulkan)
# %check runs the project's host checks, and three of them compare against
# FFmpeg (the rotation model with software transpose, and two AV1 oracles that
# need libdav1d). Without it a clean build root fails the test stage; a
# developer machine that happens to have ffmpeg hides that.
BuildRequires:  ffmpeg

# The diagnostic commands resolve the decoder node by driver name with
# v4l2-ctl, because the node number is not stable across boots on this device.
# Without v4l-utils they refuse to guess /dev/video0, which may be a camera.
# No browser is required: the driver is useful to any VA-API client.
Requires:       v4l-utils

# The upstream project was named libva-v4l2 before the qcom rename. Replace
# that package without also providing its name: a Provides and Obsoletes on
# the same name whose bound covers this package's own EVR makes DNF schedule
# the package twice. The bound sits above 1.1.1, the last upstream version,
# rather than at this package's 0.x version.
Obsoletes:      libva-v4l2 < 1.2
# Both packages install libva's msm alias, so they cannot coexist.
Conflicts:      qcom-va-driver

# The VA video processor is Vulkan compute behind the V4L2_VA_VPP opt-in.
# Without an ICD the rest of the driver still works, so this is a
# recommendation rather than a requirement.

%description
A libVA backend that drives the Qualcomm Iris V4L2 stateful decoder and
encoder, so VA-API clients such as Chromium, Google Chrome and FFmpeg can
decode and encode H.264 and HEVC in hardware instead of falling back to a
CPU codec.

The package installs the driver into libva's driver directory together with
a read-only device report and a one-command hardware check. Clients need no
wrapper and no environment variable: libva resolves the driver through the
msm_drv_video.so alias.

VA advertises H.264, HEVC, VP9 and AV1 decode, and H.264/HEVC encode; see
data/iris-codec-capabilities.json for the machine-readable support boundary.

%changelog
* Sun Oct 25 2026 Iris VA-API maintainers - 0.1.0-3
- Ship the scripts the package already referenced but did not carry: a clean
  checkout built no installer input at all.

* Sun Oct 25 2026 Iris VA-API maintainers - 0.1.0-2
- Drop the browser launcher and desktop entry: libva resolves the driver
  through the msm_drv_video.so alias, so a client needs neither.
- Replace the launcher's node queries with one shared iris-node.sh sourced by
  iris-device-check and iris-verify.

* Wed Sep 02 2026 Iris VA-API maintainers - 0.1.0-1
- First packaged snapshot: driver, diagnostics and the install provenance
  manifest in one artifact.
