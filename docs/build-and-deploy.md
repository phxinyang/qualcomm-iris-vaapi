# Build And Deploy

The target-independent build is reproducible on the development host:

```sh
CXX=/usr/bin/g++ CC=/usr/bin/gcc PKG_CONFIG=/usr/bin/pkg-config \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig meson setup build-local
ninja -C build-local
ldd -r build-local/src/v4l2_drv_video.so
```

The last command must print no `undefined symbol` lines. A successful link is
not enough for a VA-API driver: an unresolved relocation otherwise appears to
clients as a silent software-decoder fallback.

For a tablet or other V4L2 target, set `IRIS_REMOTE_HOST` to an SSH config
host or address and run:

```sh
IRIS_REMOTE_HOST=your-tablet-host ./test/remote/deploy.sh
```

The remote scripts require this variable and do not contain a project-local
host default. This keeps a public checkout from accidentally targeting a
maintainer's private lab machine.

The deploy script synchronizes by content, excludes generated build and test
artifacts, refreshes source timestamps, performs a clean Ninja rebuild, and
gates the resulting shared object with `ldd -r`. It rejects absolute,
dot-relative, parent-relative, whitespace-containing and shell-active
`IRIS_REMOTE_ROOT` values before the `rsync --delete` command can contact the
target. The remote lab directory is durable and defaults to
`$HOME/iris-vaapi-lab` (`IRIS_LAB_ROOT` overrides it); downloaded Fluster
resources and Qualcomm test tools
stay there rather than under a disposable scratch directory.

After the sync and before the rebuild, every tracked path is re-hashed on the
target with `sha256sum -c` against the host's own listing. The digest the
manifest records is therefore measured on the target rather than assumed from
the sender: a sync that delivered an older tree fails here instead of
producing a manifest that verifies against a library built from the wrong
source. A checkout without `.git` has no file list to check and says so.

Every successful deployment also writes
`build/iris-vaapi-provenance.json`. Because `.git` is deliberately not copied
to the target, `deploy.sh` resolves the full source commit and a SHA-256 over
the current contents of all tracked paths locally, then explicitly injects
both values into the clean remote build. The manifest additionally records
whether the source checkout was dirty, Meson's compiler inventory, the libva
and Meson versions, the target kernel, and the exact driver path, size and
SHA-256. Deployment immediately verifies the manifest against the generated
shared object; a copied, rebuilt or modified `.so` cannot retain a passing
record accidentally.

What the manifest verification alone does not prove is that the tree on the
target is the tree the identity names — it compares the artifact and the
identity against each other, both of which came from this host. The tracked
path check above is what closes that gap.

To re-check a deployed artifact later:

```sh
cd "$HOME/iris-vaapi-lab/src"
python3 test/remote/provenance.py verify \
  --manifest build/iris-vaapi-provenance.json \
  --artifact build/src/v4l2_drv_video.so
```

For a source export that has no local `.git`, deployment requires the source
identity to be explicit:

```sh
IRIS_SOURCE_COMMIT=<full-object-id> \
IRIS_TRACKED_SOURCE_SHA256=<sha256-of-tracked-paths> \
./test/remote/deploy.sh
```

The decoder node is resolved by the `iris_driver` name in
`test/remote/setup.sh`. Do not hardcode `/dev/video17`: V4L2 numbering changes
across boots and that node may belong to the camera subsystem. Override the
resolved node for a run with `LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH`.

After deployment, run the short positive oracle before external corpora:

```sh
ssh "$IRIS_REMOTE_HOST" 'cd "$HOME/iris-vaapi-lab/src" && \
  . ./test/lib/iris-env.sh && device=$(iris_resolve_device) && \
  LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2 \
  LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=$PWD/build/src \
  LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH="$device" \
  ./test/iris-matrix.sh'
```

The matrix requires exact software/VA frame MD5 equality and strict stateful
EOS accounting. Fluster and native V4L2 suites are additional capability and
firmware diagnostics; always record which decoder path was used.

## Durable system and browser installation

The remote deployment above intentionally runs from the build tree. Once that
artifact has passed the codec matrix and soak gates, install it into libva's
configured system driver directory together with the diagnostic commands:

```sh
cd "$HOME/iris-vaapi-lab/src"
sudo ./scripts/install-system.sh build
```

`install-system.sh` obtains `driverdir` from `pkg-config libva` (falling back
to libva's `libdir/dri` only when the package omits `driverdir`) and runs
`ldd -r` before copying the shared object. It installs the diagnostic commands
under `/usr/local/bin` and the node rule they share under
`/usr/local/lib/iris-vaapi` by default. `IRIS_INSTALL_PREFIX` changes only that
prefix; it does not redirect the VA driver away from libva's canonical driver
directory. `DESTDIR` provides a non-root packaging/staging mode.

The helper records an install manifest at
`/usr/local/share/iris-vaapi/install-manifest.txt` (or the selected prefix).
It includes the source commit, tracked-source digest, artifact hash, resolved
driver path, and any pre-existing driver backup. To remove only that recorded
installation and restore the previous driver, run
`sudo ./scripts/uninstall-system.sh`; removal refuses to proceed if the
installed artifact was modified after installation. A `DESTDIR` staging run
is packaging evidence only and must not be described as a live system install.

Package builders must refresh the manifest after any ELF post-processing. The
Fedora spec runs the distribution brp strip hooks before
`scripts/refresh-install-manifest.sh`; the Arch PKGBUILD disables makepkg's
later implicit strip, strips explicitly, and runs the same refresh. This keeps
the recorded artifact hash and size equal to the installed package payload.

The node rule lives in one file, `scripts/lib/iris-node.sh`, installed as
`<prefix>/lib/iris-vaapi/iris-node.sh`. It resolves `/dev/video*` on every
call, requires an exact `iris_driver` match, and tells the decoder from the
encoder by the card type, so the companion Iris encoder cannot be selected
merely because its number happens to sort first. An explicit
`LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH` remains available for a checked diagnostic override.
`v4l2-ctl` from v4l-utils is therefore a runtime dependency of the
diagnostics.

Three commands are installed, and none of them carries a second copy of the
node rule: `iris-device-check` and `iris-verify` both source that file, so a
boot that renumbers the nodes changes nothing in them. `iris-device-check` is
read-only and reports
the device-tree node, the bound driver, the module hash, the firmware, each
queue's coded formats, which optional kernel controls are present, and whether
libva opens the driver with no environment set. `iris-verify` generates its own
clip and checks that a decode and an encode each move the Iris interrupt
counter, that the encoded stream decodes, and that mpv reaches the native V4L2
path. `iris-configure-clients` writes `hwdec=vaapi` and the Firefox VA pref into
the invoking user's home only.

Check the installed driver with nothing set at all. This is the property the
package ships: libva resolves the driver through the `msm_drv_video.so` alias
(`qcom_drv_video.so` is installed beside it for recipes naming the qcom driver),
and the driver resolves its own node.

```sh
env -u LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH -u LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME -u LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH vainfo
```

Unset the variable; an empty `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=` is not the same thing. libva
takes the empty string as "search no directory" and `vaInitialize` fails with
`unknown libva error` even though the installed driver is fine, which is how a
2026-11-12 probe lost its first run.

There is no launcher and no desktop entry. An earlier revision shipped both,
and the launcher exported `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME`, both node paths, and an isolated
`--user-data-dir`. A desktop start then behaved differently from a terminal
start, and the isolated profile meant a user who clicked the entry got a
browser with no bookmarks and no login state. Chrome needs none of it: measured
on the qualified target with `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME` and both node overrides
removed, `--type=gpu-process` maps `/usr/lib64/dri/v4l2_drv_video.so` and holds
the decoder node while a clip plays. `test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh` launches
the browser directly and samples the holders during playback, so the same
claim is re-checked on every run.

### Browser acceptance gate

Successful playback is not proof of hardware decoding. Use a high-resolution
H.264 or HEVC sample, open `chrome://media-internals`, select the player by its
exact URL, and require both:

```text
kVideoDecoderName = VaapiVideoDecoder
kIsPlatformVideoDecoder = true
```

The qualified Chrome 151 run on August 30, 2026 reached this gate with the
project driver mapped in the GPU process and a dynamically resolved Iris node,
`VaapiVideoDecoder`, and `kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=true`; its VA trace then
showed repeated `vaBeginPicture`/`vaEndPicture` and `stateful capture complete`
events. The Fedora Chromium 151 run is a separate native-V4L2 baseline and
reported `V4L2VideoDecoder`; that result does not prove the project's VA driver.

Also record decoded/dropped frame counts, confirm the Iris V4L2 context and
OUTPUT/CAPTURE activity in a trace-enabled diagnostic run, and compare the
device boot ID before and after. Small videos may fall below Chromium's
hardware-decoder performance threshold, so a low-resolution
`FFmpegVideoDecoder` result is not a release verdict. H.264, HEVC, VP9 and
AV1 are the qualified VA profiles (each with its own caveat in the README).
Validate Google
Chrome; Fedora's Chromium decodes through its own native V4L2 stack and its
result says nothing about this driver.

### Recording a target run

A gate result means nothing without the boot, module and driver it ran
against, and those were being copied out of the target by hand for every
claim. `test/remote/gate.sh` runs one command inside the remote checkout
under `scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh` and writes the identity, the exit
status, the guard state and the source commit next to the command's output:

```sh
IRIS_REMOTE_HOST=your-tablet-host test/remote/gate.sh \
    --out ~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/run-$$ \
    -- sh test/iris-gstreamer-gate.sh --clip CLIP
```

The record is `summary.json` with schema `qualcomm-iris-vaapi/target-run-v1`,
plus `identity.txt`, `command.stdout`, `command.stderr` and the guard
directory copied back from the target. The runner does not deploy: it reports
the driver and module hashes the target holds, so a run against a stale
install is visible in the record instead of being remembered. A guard that
stopped the run exits 3, and its state says why.

## Distribution packaging

`scripts/install-system.sh` is enough for a lab target, but it needs a build
tree, a checkout and root. For an image that should work on first boot, build
a package instead. All three manifests live under `packaging/` (and `debian/`)
and all three install through that same script, so the packaged layout cannot
drift from the one the lab uses:

| Target | Manifest | libva driver directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fedora aarch64 | `packaging/fedora/libva-v4l2-iris.spec` | `%{_libdir}/dri` |
| Arch aarch64 | `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` | `/usr/lib/dri` |
| Debian/Ubuntu arm64 | `debian/rules` | `/usr/lib/$(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)/dri` |

```sh
# Fedora
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=libva-v4l2-iris-0.1.0/ \
    -o ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/libva-v4l2-iris-0.1.0.tar.gz HEAD
rpmbuild -ba packaging/fedora/libva-v4l2-iris.spec \
    --define "source_commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
    --define "tracked_sha256 $(git ls-files -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')"

# Debian/Ubuntu, from a checkout
dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc

# Debian/Ubuntu, from a tarball that has no .git
IRIS_SOURCE_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
IRIS_TRACKED_SOURCE_SHA256=$(git ls-files -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}') \
IRIS_SOURCE_DIRTY=0 \
    dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc
```

The Debian build reads the source identity from the checkout, or from
`IRIS_SOURCE_COMMIT`, `IRIS_TRACKED_SOURCE_SHA256` and `IRIS_SOURCE_DIRTY` in
the environment when it builds from a tarball with no `.git` — the same
contract `rpmbuild --define` and the PKGBUILD's variables follow. With neither,
the install is recorded dirty rather than claiming an identity nothing
verified.

All three build-depend on FFmpeg, because their test stage runs the host checks
and three of those compare against it — the rotation model against software
transpose, and two AV1 oracles against `libdav1d`. A machine that happens to
have FFmpeg installed hides the missing build dependency until a clean build
root runs the test stage and fails there.

All three declare `v4l-utils` as a hard runtime dependency. The diagnostic commands
resolve the decoder node by driver name because the number moves between boots
on this device, and without `v4l2-ctl` they exit instead of falling back to a
fixed `/dev/videoN` that may be a camera.

No browser is a dependency, and no browser is configured. The driver is useful
to any VA-API client, and libva resolves it through the alias without help.

Which browser benefits differs by distribution. On Fedora 44, Chromium
151.0.7922.169 already decodes in hardware through Chromium's own native V4L2
stack and reports `V4L2VideoDecoder` without loading this driver at all.
Google Chrome has no such path and is the client this driver exists for; it is
the one that moves from `FFmpegVideoDecoder` to `VaapiVideoDecoder`.

`test/iris-packaging-check.sh` runs in CI and fails when an installed path is
missing from the spec's `%files`, when any of the three manifests stops
delegating to `install-system.sh`, when a manifest stops refreshing the
provenance file after its own strip step, when `v4l-utils` is dropped, when a
format forgets the Vulkan build dependency that the video processor needs, or
when one of the three diagnostics stops being installed beside the driver.

Debian and Ubuntu packaging exists for one aarch64 target and is built in a
clean chroot, not on the device. The reason it took until now is the build
dependency, not the package: `libgbm-dev` is a Mesa package pinned to an exact
`libgbm1`, and installing it into a vendor-Mesa system can downgrade the
graphics stack the vendor shipped. A build chroot (`sbuild`, `pbuilder`) never
touches the running system, which is what the Debian toolchain assumes anyway;
installing build dependencies directly on the tablet is still the wrong move.
Because Meson treats GBM as optional (`meson.build`), a machine without the
development package still builds — the CPU copy engine stays and the GPU blit
path in `iris/gpu_copy.cc` is not compiled in. That is a slower Copy policy,
not a broken build, and it is not the configuration any record in
`TEST-RESULTS.md` measured. The Debian package therefore build-depends on
`libgbm-dev` and lets `${shlibs:Depends}` carry the runtime library, so a
package built in a chroot installs on a device whose own Mesa already
provides it.

For the Arch image projects, drop `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` into the image
repository's `pkgs/libva-v4l2-iris/` directory and add it to the package list.
The generated rootfs then ships the driver in libva's standard directory and
no user has to set `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`. That path is not validated here: the
qualified target in this repository is Fedora, and an Arch image needs its own
`vainfo` and `media-internals` acceptance before its result may be claimed.

## Dynamic resolution qualification

The production/fallback/rejected codec boundary is machine-readable in
`data/iris-codec-capabilities.json`; keep it in sync with source capability
advertisement and test expectations. It is intentionally conservative: a
codec with an empty `va_profiles` list is not a VA production capability even
when the native V4L2 node can decode it.

For experiments that may reset firmware, wrap the bounded command with
`scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh -- ...`. It records the initial boot ID,
thermal samples, pack state (`battery.log`: capacity, charging status, voltage,
current and USB online), the display and network boundary
(`display.log`: connector state, `enabled`, `dpms`, preferred mode string,
brightness and fbcon blank level; `network.log`: `up`/`down` per interface;
`command.txt`: the run's own argv, one argument per line) and command output,
enforces a timeout, and refuses to reuse a running guard file until the
previous run has been inspected. A power run is only attributable to decode
when those boundaries are recorded: the kernel does not expose the active
refresh rate to an unprivileged reader, so the report states the refresh it
measured under rather than implying it from `display.log`. Battery
level is a recorded boundary, not a start gate: a discharging or low pack is
valid lab state, and the report must say what the pack did. Classify a long
run by the recorded start/end capacity; a shortened window is a shortened
result, not a cancelled experiment. Temperature works the same way at the top
end: the ceiling (`IRIS_EXPERIMENT_MAX_TEMP_MILLIC`, default 100000) is a
runaway backstop 10 K under the zones' 110000 critical trip, not a comfort
line, and the firmware's own passive throttle band (90000/95000) is inside it.
a record whose peak lands above 95000 must say so. A reset, a boot-ID change
or a trip past the ceiling is a failed experiment, not evidence of codec
support.

Run the dedicated H.264 reconfiguration gate on the target:

```sh
. ./test/lib/iris-env.sh
device=$(iris_resolve_device)
LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2 \
LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=$PWD/build/src \
LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH="$device" \
./test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh
```

The production default assembles deterministic 640x360 and 1280x720 keyframe
segments into streams with exactly 100 geometry changes. H.264 passes only if
the native GStreamer V4L2 decoder produces byte-identical I420 output, one
FFmpeg VA process survives every change with exact software frame MD5 and EOS
accounting, and 101 fresh VA processes decode the alternating geometries with
the same checks. FFmpeg is allowed to recreate VA contexts on a coded-size
change; the single-process lane therefore qualifies context retirement and
session cleanup rather than asserting a client behavior FFmpeg does not have.

VP9 runs the same lanes with `IRIS_DYNAMIC_CODECS=vp9`; on the decode-order
kernel module it passed all 100 switches in both lanes (TEST-RESULTS.md,
Phase 5). Run it through `scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh` on any other
kernel, because the old display-order module rebooted on VP9 source changes.
A missing device format, required element or VA capability is a failure,
not a skip.
Development runs may shorten the matrix explicitly with
`IRIS_DYNAMIC_SWITCHES` and `IRIS_DYNAMIC_FRAMES_PER_SEGMENT`; qualification
results must retain the defaults.

## Concurrent soak qualification

The concurrent runner has separate dual-H.264 and mixed H.264+HEVC scenarios:

```sh
./test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh dual-h264
./test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh mixed
# Run both sequentially:
./test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh all
```

Each selected scenario defaults to 7200 seconds of wall-clock playback, using
real-time throttling rather than decoding two hours of timestamps as quickly
as possible. Before the soak starts, every selected codec must pass an exact
software/VA frame-MD5 oracle. During the run the script records progress,
driver traces, boot ID, uptime and every readable thermal zone. It terminates
workers and fails on a boot-ID change, an unreadable thermal inventory, a
temperature above 100000 millidegrees Celsius, a driver timeout/timestamp
error, incomplete stateful teardown, too few decoded frames, or any worker
failure.

`IRIS_SOAK_SECONDS` may shorten a development run, but the report is labelled
`SHORTENED` unless it is exactly 7200 seconds. `IRIS_SOAK_MAX_TEMP_MILLIC` and
`IRIS_SOAK_TEMPERATURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` tune the thermal guard. A durable
guard file records a running test; a later invocation refuses to hide an
interrupted or rebooted soak until the operator inspects it and deliberately
sets `IRIS_SOAK_ALLOW_STALE_GUARD=1`.

## Host-side release gate

The CI and local release sequence is:

```sh
meson setup build
ninja -C build
sh test/run-static-checks.sh
meson test -C build --list
meson test -C build --no-rebuild --print-errorlogs
ldd -r build/src/v4l2_drv_video.so
```

CI asserts that the Meson inventory is non-empty and names every required
hardware-independent test, including `stateful-session` and the provenance
tamper test, before executing it. This prevents a renamed, unregistered or
unbuilt behavioural test from yielding an empty green result.
