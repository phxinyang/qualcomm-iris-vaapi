# Testing

## Host Unit Tests
Run the host-side unit tests without hardware:
```sh
meson test -C build-local
```

## Hardware Gates
On the tablet, run the following verification gates:
- `test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh --clip ...`: verifies Chrome `VaapiVideoDecoder` selection, platform decoder status, and zero dropped frames.
- `test/iris-matrix.sh`: framemd5 output equivalence against software.
- `test/iris-structure-matrix.sh`: decoding structural variants (all-I, B-frames).
- `test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh`: handles in-stream resolution changes.
- `test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh`: multi-context thermal/stability soaking.
- `test/av1-obu-roundtrip.sh`: software oracle for AV1 OBU repacking.

## Qualcomm Iris codec matrix

The repeatable matrix (media generation, VA-API decode through FFmpeg, EOS
oracle and per-frame MD5 against software) is `test/iris-matrix.sh`. Every
script resolves the Iris node by driver name through `test/lib/iris-env.sh`
and keeps artifacts under `~/Lab/iris-vaapi-lab/artifacts/` by default:

```
LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=$PWD/build/src ./test/iris-matrix.sh
```

H.264, HEVC and VP9 run through VA and must match software exactly; AV1 runs
its native GStreamer baseline only (its VA lane is opt-in and documented in
the README). `IRIS_MATRIX_FRAMES` shortens a development run.

`test/iris-structure-matrix.sh` isolates H.264 reference structure: all-I,
IP-only, B=2 and B=4 streams with exact MD5 equality. Keep GOP-middle
`-c copy` clips out of this positive matrix; a cut that starts on a P/B
picture without its references is a negative random-access test.

`test/iris-zero-copy-suite.sh` is the Direct-path oracle: FFmpeg does not
pre-export surfaces, so every completion must be `publish=direct` with zero
copy-engine involvement and software-identical pixels.

`test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh` alternates 640x360 and 1280x720 one
hundred times for H.264 (default) or VP9 (`IRIS_DYNAMIC_CODECS=vp9`) and
requires byte-identical native output, exact MD5 from one VA process across
every change, and exact output from 101 fresh VA processes.
`IRIS_DYNAMIC_SWITCHES` shortens a development run.

For dual-H.264 and mixed H.264+HEVC soaks:

```
./test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh dual-h264
./test/iris-concurrency-soak.sh mixed
```

Both default to two hours, retain progress, traces, temperature samples and
boot IDs, refuse to start after an interrupted predecessor (guard file),
enforce an 85 C ceiling, wait for the SoC to cool after generating media, and
run an exact MD5 preflight first. `IRIS_SOAK_SECONDS` shortens a development
run; shortened output is labelled and is not release evidence.

Trace checkers for a client run with `V4L2_VA_TRACE=1` (the record
vocabulary is in `docs/architecture.md` §8):

```
test/iris-eos-check.sh /path/to/trace.log 720            # every AU completed, one drain
test/iris-eos-check.sh /path/to/trace.log 720 --allow-bounded-sync
test/iris-ending-check.sh /path/to/trace.log             # no sync timeouts, terminal drain present
test/iris-context-retirement-check.sh /path/to/trace.log # every destroyed context finished
```

Firmware experiments (anything that can reset the decoder) go through
`scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh -- command`, which records the boot ID and
temperature, applies a timeout, and leaves an `interrupted` marker that must
be reviewed before another run.

## Full target hardware suite

`iris-hardware-suite.sh` combines the repository matrices with a V4L2
capability inventory, `v4l2-compliance`, native GStreamer EOS checks, the
Qualcomm `v4l-video-test-app`, and optional Fluster conformance runs. It is
device-agnostic, probes for `iris_driver`, and fails rather than guessing a
node; set `V4L2_DEVICE` (or `LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH`) for an inspected override.
All logs and generated media stay
under `$HOME/Lab/Bridge/tmp/trash`:

```
IRIS_HARDWARE_SUITE_DIR=$HOME/Lab/Bridge/tmp/trash/iris-hardware-suite \
./test/iris-hardware-suite.sh
```

The repository matrices are enabled by default. Set `IRIS_RUN_REPO_MATRICES=0`
when only external tools are desired. To add the Qualcomm JSON client, point
`IRIS_V4L_TEST_BINARY` at `iris_v4l2_test` and provide a whitespace-separated
`IRIS_V4L_TEST_CONFIGS` list. Set `IRIS_V4L_TEST_CWD` to the Qualcomm
checkout root when a JSON file uses relative `InputPath`/`Outputpath` values.
To add Fluster, set `FLUSTER_DIR`,
`IRIS_FLUSTER_SUITES` and `IRIS_FLUSTER_DECODERS`, for example:

```
FLUSTER_DIR=$HOME/Lab/iris-vaapi-lab/tools/fluster \
IRIS_FLUSTER_SUITES='JVT-AVC_V1 JCT-VC-HEVC_V1 VP9-TEST-VECTORS AV1-TEST-VECTORS' \
IRIS_FLUSTER_DECODERS='GStreamer-H.264-V4L2' \
./test/iris-hardware-suite.sh
```

`GStreamer-*-V4L2` talks directly to the Iris kernel node and therefore
characterises firmware capabilities without loading this VA-API driver. To
exercise this repository's code, select the matching `FFmpeg-*-VAAPI` decoder:

```
FLUSTER_DIR=$HOME/Lab/iris-vaapi-lab/tools/fluster \
IRIS_FLUSTER_SUITES='JVT-AVC_V1' \
IRIS_FLUSTER_DECODERS='FFmpeg-H.264-VAAPI' \
V4L2_VA_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS=100 \
./test/iris-hardware-suite.sh
```

Fluster's stock FFmpeg VA-API wrapper uses a software pixel-format filter and
does not request a VAAPI output pool explicitly. Its results are useful for
finding surface-lifetime and timeout boundaries, but the repository's
`iris-matrix.sh` is the authoritative positive VA-API pixel oracle. Record the
decoder name with every Fluster result so firmware-only numbers are not
mistaken for driver coverage. Fluster's non-zero result is retained as a
capability warning because its corpus intentionally includes profiles, bit
depths, dimensions and dynamic-resolution modes that a particular Iris
firmware may not implement. The raw JSON and log are the review artifacts.
`v4l2-compliance` is strict except for the known stateful mem2mem control
classification; set
`IRIS_ALLOW_KNOWN_COMPLIANCE_LIMIT=0` to make that result fail the suite.

## Open-source test corpora

There is no single corpus that covers both codec conformance and browser
surface-lifetime behavior. Use the following projects together:

- [Fluster](https://github.com/fluendo/fluster) is the primary codec
  conformance corpus. It includes H.264/AVC, HEVC, VP9 and AV1 suites with
  reference checksums, and can run an external decoder command. The current
  suites include 204 H.264 vectors (`JVT-AVC_V1` + `JVT-FR-EXT`), 147 HEVC
  vectors, 311 VP9 vectors and 242 AV1 vectors. A focused download is:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/fluendo/fluster.git
  cd fluster
  ./fluster.py download JVT-AVC_V1 JVT-FR-EXT JCT-VC-HEVC_V1 VP9-TEST-VECTORS AV1-TEST-VECTORS
  ./fluster.py list
  ```

  Start with one vector and the software decoder, then add the VA-API decoder
  wrapper. Compare decoded frame count and pixels, not only process exit status.
- [Chromium media/test/data](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/media/test/data/)
  is useful for container and playback regressions. In particular,
  `front-discard.mp4`, `mid-file-start-time.mp4`, `bear-1280x720.mp4`,
  `avc-bitstream-format-0.h264` and `avc-bitstream-format-1.h264` cover short
  files, non-zero start timestamps, discard-at-start and H.264 framing. The
  directory also contains VP9/HEVC/AV1 samples and documents how each file
  was generated.
- [GStreamer GstValidate](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gst-devtools/gst-validate.html)
  is a scenario runner rather than a corpus. It is useful for replaying a
  downloaded clip through play, seek, flush and EOS scenarios, for example:

  ```
  gst-validate-1.0 playbin uri=file:///path/to/sample.mp4
  ```

- [Qualcomm v4l-video-test-app](https://github.com/quic/v4l-video-test-app)
  provides a V4L2 decoder test client and JSON-configured codec cases. It is a
  good native baseline for Iris, while [v4l2-compliance](https://github.com/gjasny/v4l-utils/blob/master/utils/v4l2-compliance/v4l2-test-codecs.cpp)
  checks ioctl/queue semantics rather than decoded picture correctness.

For the current Iris investigation, the smallest useful local set is the
generated 1-3 second matrix (all-I, IP-only, B-frame, long-GOP and a GOP-middle
`-c copy` clip) plus Chromium's `mid-file-start-time.mp4`. Record codec/profile,
GOP/B-frame structure, start PTS, decoded frame count, per-frame MD5 or pixel
error, CAPTURE/OUTPUT/`LAST` counts, timestamp misses and bounded sync timeouts.
The positive 640x360 matrix currently passes for IP/all-I/B=2/B=4. The
long-GOP middle-cut sample remains a negative random-access/contract test.
