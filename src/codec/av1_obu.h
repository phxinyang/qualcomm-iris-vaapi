// the OBUs back out from the parameter struct.
//
// The reconstruction does not have to reproduce the original bytes, only a
// stream that decodes to the same pixels. Where VA omits a field that is ours
// to choose (level, frame id numbering, timing info) the writer picks a value
// and stays self-consistent with it.

// hint stored in each of the eight reference slots. Maintained by the caller
// across frames, since skip-mode signalling depends on it.
