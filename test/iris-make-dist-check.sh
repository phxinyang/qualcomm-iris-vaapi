# unpack, the files their build reads, and the dirty-tree refusal. Working in
# a throwaway fixture keeps the developer's own uncommitted changes out of it.
# An RPM build has already unpacked that archive, so the repository-side half
# of this check is skipped there; the packaging checks still run from it.
